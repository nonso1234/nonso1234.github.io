I and three other students worked with the Ocean's simulations lab at SouthWest Research Institute, for our Capstone project, to solve a unique water conservation problem at the lab. 

We designed and fabricated a passive Oil Water separation and filtration system to improve current test water dumping procedures and reduce the use of catridge filters. Our design include the following major components:

- A settling tank: Settling tank allows for gradual sediment settling. Tank also holds most of the transient water. Tank capacity is ~80 gallons.

- Float skimmer: Float skimmer seives oil build up concentrated on the water surface in the build up region. Oil is seived down to a small catch tank.

- Coalescing media: The coalescing media improves oil separation by the increasing oil droplet size as water flows through.

- Skid mount: The skid mount is a base support for the whole system with a forklift allowance for transportation.
